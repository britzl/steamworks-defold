# steamworks-defold
[Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/home) support for Defold using the Defold extension system

## Installation
You can use Steamworks in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

	https://github.com/britzl/steamworks-defold/archive/master.zip

Or point to the ZIP file of a [specific release](https://github.com/britzl/steamworks-defold/releases).

### App ID
The Steamworks API will not initialize if it does not know the App ID of your game. When you launch your app from Steam itself then it will automatically have the App ID available. While developing you will need to hint this to Steam with a text file. Create the a text file called `steam_appid.txt` next to your executable containing just the App ID and nothing else. This overrides the value that Steam provides. You should not ship this with your builds.

## Usage
### Basic example

	function init(self)
		steamworks.init()

		steamworks.set_listener(function(self, event, data)
			print(event)
			pprint(data)
			if event == "UserStatsReceived_t" then
				print("Got user stats")
				pprint(data)
			end
		end)

		local user_id = steamworks.user_get_steam_id()
		steamworks.user_stats_request_current_stats()
	end

	function final(self)
		steamworks.final()
	end

	function update(self, dt)
		steamworks.update()
	end

## Using the SteamAPI
The extension exposes most of the Steamworks functionality through an auto-generated API. Refer to the [API Overview](steamworks/api_ref.md) for a list of all generated functions, constants and callbacks.

NOTE: Please [create a ticket](https://github.com/britzl/steamworks-defold/issues/new) if there's an unsupported API that you need!

### Naming convention
Function names are converted to snake case using the following convention:

	SteamMatchmaking()->GetLobbyDataByIndex() -> steamworks.matchmaking_get_lobby_data_by_index()
	SteamNetworking()->IsP2PPacketAvailable() -> steamworks.networking_is_p2p_packet_available()

### Generating the API
The API is generated from the `steam_api.json` which is part of the Steamworks SDK. The generator is written in Python using a Mustache template, `generate.py` and `extension.mtl` respectively. The script requires `pystache` (install using `pip install pystache`). Some minor alterations have been made to the `steam_api.json` definition file.

## Example app
Refer to the `examples` folder for an Defold application that showcases the use of many parts of the API. Build the example app from Defold and run it from the command line using one of `run_osx.sh`, `run_x86_64-linux.sh` and `run_x86_64-win32.bat`.
